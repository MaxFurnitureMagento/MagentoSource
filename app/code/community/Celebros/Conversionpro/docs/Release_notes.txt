Knows Issues:
1. In the scenario where a category is set to not act as an anchor, but has a layout that contains a left
	sidebar, the sidebar will contain a list of categories that do not derive from Salesperson's servers,
	even if the navigation to search feature is enabled.
	
	To make sure navigation to search displays the category page correctly, 
	take note of the following category configurations:
	I. Under 'General Information', 'Is Active' is set to 'Yes'.
	II. Under 'Display Settings', 'Display Mode' is either 'Products only' or 'Static blocks and products'.
	III. Under 'Display Settings', 'Is Anchor' is set to 'Yes'. 
	IV. Under 'Custom Settings', 'Page Layout' is set to '2 columns with left bar'.
